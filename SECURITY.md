# 🛡️ Security Policy

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure
1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email** the maintainer privately or create a private security advisory on GitHub
3. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability and steps to reproduce
4. **Allow** reasonable time for response and fix before public disclosure

### ⏱️ Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity (critical issues prioritized)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

## 🔐 Security Measures

### 🏗️ Secure Development Practices
- **Code Review**: All changes go through pull request review process
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of all dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Code analysis during build process
- **Minimal Permissions**: Application runs with user-level permissions only
- **No Network Access**: Application operates entirely offline
- **No Data Collection**: Zero telemetry or data transmission

### 📦 Release Security
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials included with each release
- **Checksum Verification**: SHA256 hashes provided for all release files
- **Vulnerability Reports**: Pre-release dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Secure Build Flags**: Production builds use security-hardened compilation
- **Reproducible Builds**: GitHub Actions provides transparent, auditable build process

### 🔍 Verification Instructions

#### 1. Checksum Verification
```powershell
# Download release and SHA256SUMS.txt
# Verify file integrity
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 VirtualDesktopIndicator-v1.0.0-win-x64-portable.zip

# Compare with value in SHA256SUMS.txt
```

#### 2. SBOM Review
```bash
# Extract release archive
# Review VirtualDesktopIndicator.sbom.json for dependencies
# Check for known vulnerabilities in dependency list
```

#### 3. Source Code Audit
- **Repository**: Fully open source at [GitHub](https://github.com/balgaly/VirtualDesktopIndicator)
- **License**: MIT License - commercial and private use allowed
- **Transparency**: All development happens in public repository

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

### 🔓 Code Signing Status
- **Current**: This open source project does **NOT** include code signing
- **Impact**: Windows will show "Unknown Publisher" warnings
- **Mitigation**: Verify checksums and review source code before execution
- **Future**: Investigating free code signing options for open source projects

### 🛠️ Recommended Security Practices

#### For Users:
1. **Download Source**: Only from official GitHub releases
2. **Verify Checksums**: Always check SHA256 hashes before execution
3. **Review SBOM**: Check dependency list for concerning packages
4. **Run Sandboxed**: Consider running in isolated environment initially
5. **Keep Updated**: Monitor for security updates and patches

#### For Developers:
1. **Audit Dependencies**: Regularly review and update dependencies
2. **Follow Secure Coding**: Use security best practices in contributions
3. **Test Security**: Include security considerations in testing
4. **Report Issues**: Immediately report any security concerns

## 🎯 Security Architecture

### 🔒 Application Security
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Simple, focused functionality
- **No Network Communications**: Entirely local operation
- **Registry Access**: Read-only access to Windows virtual desktop registry
- **System APIs**: Limited to desktop switching and tray notifications
- **Memory Safety**: Managed .NET runtime provides memory protection

### 🏛️ Infrastructure Security
- **GitHub Actions**: Builds run in isolated, ephemeral environments
- **No Secrets**: No sensitive data stored in repository or workflows
- **Audit Trail**: All changes tracked in Git history
- **Automated Scanning**: Dependency vulnerabilities detected automatically
